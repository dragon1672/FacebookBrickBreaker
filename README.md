Quicky Implementation and Basic AI for Facebook's Brick Pop / BrickBreaker game (called BrickPop but the code references are BrickBreaker)

There is some hacky code in here, and the AI stalls out on quite some boards.

## Warnings

 * This code is sloppy and hacky, sorry.
 * The AI works most of the time

## Plans

 * Writing and auto player in JS so you don't have to input moves manually
 * Fixing AI and playing more with it
 * Making a playable version of the game with a UI or something

## Tips for QuickAI

Make a couple solid begining moves and rerun the board. 

I added support for whitespaces in the seed image/string so you don't have to have a new board
